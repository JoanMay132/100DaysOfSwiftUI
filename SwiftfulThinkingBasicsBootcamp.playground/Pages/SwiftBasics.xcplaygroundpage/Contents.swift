//Naming Conventions

//Camel Case - CORRECT
//The first word is lowercased and then the first character in every following word is uppercased
let firstGreeting = "Hello, World!"
let thisIsMyFirstGreeting = "Hello, World"

//Snake case - WRONG
let this_is_what_snake_case_looks_like = "Hello, World"
